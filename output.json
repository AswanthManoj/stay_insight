It‚Äôs always a great pleasure to visit  occasionally with family here.\n\nPlace is spacious and sits in the middle of the town on the ground floor of Mughal Mall. Not always crowded. The staff syncs with the people visiting here as they are purely localites.\n\nAnd tried the Secret Burger of KFC. Superb. Humongous. And juicy as usual . You will finish sweating . It‚Äôs that good and big.\n\nParking inside the mall, so the fees are !\n\nOverall a family gathering spot!!"},{"user":"Aakash","date":"July 07, 2018 at 12:30 PM UTC","rating":5.0,"review_text":"It's quite good\nFoods are really great.
